        <p> This is my first webpage and it has been a fun learning experience so far.
            I'm very excited to take this course and to see all of the stuff I'm going to do and learn, this assignment started out a little daunting
            but has become a fun and challenging experience. Learning HTML had been difficult as at first glance it looks very overwhelming with trying to remember tags and where they go. Here are some things I've learned since starting the class.</p>
        <p>Since last time I've learned how to use basic CSS such as creating borders, changing fonts, and adding colors.
            CSS has been fun to learn and the analogy of HTML being a skeleton and CSS being like skin and features makes a lot of sense.
