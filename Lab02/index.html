        <p> This is my first webpage and it has been a fun learning experience so far.
            I'm very excited to take this course and to see all of the stuff I'm going to do and learn, this assignment started out a little daunting
            but has become a fun and challenging experience. Learning HTML had been difficult as at first glance it looks very overwhelming with trying to remember tags and where they go. Here are some things I've learned since starting the class</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Leanred how tags work in relation to the document</li>
            <li>Learned how orginization is important when it comes to files and folders</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Things I'm excited about leanring in the future</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning about CSS and how it interacts with HTML</li>
            <li>Learning about differnet tags and how they affect the document</li>
            <li><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics>This site helped me a lot</a></li>
