        <h1>Site Evaluation</h1>
        <p>I chose to use the University of Arkansas website for this lab.</p>
        <h2>Questions from site eval</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>The url is www.uark.com</li>
        <li>The sites target audience are people who interested in joining the university.</li>
        <li>I think the site is organized very well it's easy to understand and follow doesn't have too many pathways to click on and the design of the page is nice and clean.</li>
        <li> The CRAP principle it uses the most is Repetitions shown by the font being the same accross the site and the colors of red and white.</li>
        <li>The audit score however for this site is a 66 which is not the best</li>
        <li>I think the site is effective for what it is intended to be used for and completes actions well</li>
        <li>I would say the site is appropriate for what it is supposed to be</li>
        <li>To improve the site I would optimize it better for accessability such as ensuring that all ARIA attributes have valid values.</li>
        </ol>
