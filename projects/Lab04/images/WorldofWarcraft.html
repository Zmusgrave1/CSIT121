            <img src="FcE1oN5wFNLP.gif" alt="World of Warcraft Logo">
            <p>This is a gif of the World of Warcraft logo. World of Warcraft is an MMORPG developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The game was released in 2004 and is currently enjoying its 20th anniversary. The game is still played by millions to this day. I chose the gif because I thought it was an interesting twist on the logo that I hadn't seen before.</p>
