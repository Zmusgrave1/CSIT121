            <p>This is a picture of Thrall, an orc who at one time was the leader of the Horde. He was raised by humans to become a gladiator. Eventually, he overthrew the man who enslaved him and rallied the other orcs, turning them into a force that would one day rival the Alliance itself. I chose this image because Thrall is one of the most interesting characters in all of Warcraft lore and has a history of existing since 2001.</p>
