            <p>Hello! This semester was a challenging one but rewarding I feeel like I've learned a lot, but also feel like I could've done better. There were some concepts that were easier to understand than others. This semester I learned how to makea multi page site, leanr about xml and generally get a better understanding of html and css and how they relate and work within one another.</p>
            <p>This semester also taught me a lot about myself and if I want to continue down this path and I very much do while I still feel like I have a lot to learn and clean up, I'm excited at that oppurtunity.</p>
            <p>I can say it's really cool to see how you type in html and watch a webpage come to life much like an architect designs a building you can make it look hoe you want with the tools availiable to you, such as xml being like a frame and the corresponding html being the drywall that makes it look nice.  </p>
