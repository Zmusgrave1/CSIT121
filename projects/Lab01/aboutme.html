            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a non traditional student, I'm fairly new to Maryland having moved here last April with my wife
                and three daughters. My kids are 17, 12, and 5 so this year has been a little hectic with high school, middle school, and kindergarten but I wouldn't change any of it.

             This is my second semester at CCBC studying Information Technology after switching from being an Education major. I hope to graduate this upcoming Spring.
